## Backend file for monitoring of road infrastructure
 The Backend of this project enables us to:
   1. Road damages by the input of the dash cam feed of PCR vehicles .
   2. Prediction of potholes  during petrolling  by using YOLO .

   3. At same time Dash cam will note real time location .
   4. Classification of different type of holes .
   5. Updating web page , location of hole and size of hole .
   6. Web generate risk level due to pot , cracks (  Poor ,moderate , Critical).
   7. Information is avialable on web for both persons and administrative people 
   
   Additionally.....
   1. For a certain region of road(like 15 to 20 km) there will be highway cameras .
   2. This camera detects the type of vehicle and classify it into three categories light , medium and heavy.

      By this  administration will get to know that if there will be contiunuous heavy vehicles then road will wear out much easily
      Wearing of road depends on how many number of times vehicle passes over it and which type of vehcle .
      There is a certain paper on how vehicle mass effects

   3.We also provide feed of that road to web , so that person who travel can get to know which is better route
   4. Also by this data administration will  take action soon.
   5. There is also forecastng of road destruction by weather forecasting . 
   Ex - Small holes will become larger due to rain , so it is dangerous for drivers .
